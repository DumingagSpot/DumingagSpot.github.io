<H4>Introduction<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp; Colleen Pabiran, like many children, she had many beautiful memories of childhood; she's born in a happy home filled with parental affection, impregnated with family joys, and sanctified by prayers. The aesthetic landscape and scenery of Dumingag impressed her as a growing child and deeply influenced her mind, attitude and character. The happiest period of her life was truly her childhood days in her natal town.<br>
<br><br>
San Pablo<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp; San Pablo is situated on a verdant plain by an agricultural land of Dumingag Municipality. It's within the centers vicinity. A few kilometers to the North is barangay Marangan where clear as cellophane falls is located. A few kilometers to the west is barangay Salvador with its rippling majestic falls.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; San Pablo, with its fertile fields of rice, its evermore green meadows of innumerable fruit trees and its singing birds abounding in the twigs to the fields, its starry nights "filled with the poetry of sadness" its lovely sunrise over the mountains and its charming panoramic views, is a fit place to nurture a generous, loving and kind child.<br>
<br><br>
Earliest Childhood Memories<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp; The first memory of Colleen was playing outside the playground and picking at her youngest brother who barely knows how to walk. At times, she was left alone to ponder the beauty of nature. She remembers watching other children from her neighborhood played, while the birds like maya and pipit surrounds them and flung high up to the sky.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; She was jokingly called "Kol", that sounds like the short term for uncle by her cousins and big brother. The people in San Pablo just simply called her "Colleen". She was closest to her younger brother who can't still talk and argued with her at that time.<br>
<br><br>
Devoted child of the church<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp; Colleen was enrolled in a religious school, surrounded with good people and good mentor. She grew up as a good SDA.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; At the age of 3, she remembered her mother teaching her to sing in the Glory of God. She vividly remembered how she joins her family during family worshiped and muttered what her mother sing and/or dictates.<br> 
&emsp;&emsp; At the age of 4, she started performing in front of the church stage among her classmates to inspire other kids to be used in the service of the Lord.<br>
